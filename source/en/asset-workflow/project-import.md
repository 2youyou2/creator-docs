## Brief

You can import projects of other editors by the Main Menu `File->Import Project`. Now supportted:

* Cocos Studio Projects (*.ccs)
* Cocos Builder Projects (*.ccbproj)

The menu looks like:

![import-menu](./project-import/import-menu.png)

## Steps

1. Click the right menu item, there will be a Open File dialog.
2. Select a file with the specified extension like this:

	![select-file.png](./project-import/select-file.png)

3. When the Cocos Creator is processing the import, logs will be output in **Console**. The log looks like this:

	![import-process.png](./project-import/import-process.png)
	
	Details:
	* The full path of the imported project.
	* Log the file now importing.
	* When the importing finished, you will see a line like this: `Import XXX project finished.`. (XXX should be the project type.)
	* At last, the url of imported resources will be shown.

**PS:**
The time of importing depends on the size of the project. When it's importing, please don't operate the Cocos Creator. You should wait for the importing finished.

## Details of Importing Cocos Studio Projects

### The solution

* There are 3 kinds of csd files in Cocos Studio projectï¼š
	* Scene ---- Imported as a scene (.fire)
	* Layer ---- Imported as a prefab
	* Node ---- Imported as a prefab
* The animation data in csd files will be imported as .anim files.
* The File Structure after the project imported:
	* The resources will be stored in a separate folder in assets. The folder name will be same with the Cocos Studio project name.
	* The File Structure will be same with the Cocos Studio project.
	* The animation files will be stored in a child folder. The folder name will be `[csd file name]_action`
* Now some widgets in Cocos Studio are not supported in Cocos Creator. The importing process will add a StudioComponent for the node with unsupported widgets. And the data of the widgets will be stored in the StudioComponent. Unsupported widgets:
	* CheckBox
	* LabelAtlas
	* SliderBar
	* ListView
	* PageView
* The data of StudioComponent will be looks like this:

	![studio-component.png](./project-import/studio-component.png)
